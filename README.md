# Student Record Management System (Java CLI Project)

This is a simple Java project I built as part of a Java Developer Internship task. It’s a command-line based application to manage student records where you can add, view, update, and delete students using a menu-driven interface.

The project helped me practice core Java concepts like classes, encapsulation, ArrayList, and basic CRUD operations.
##  What the project does
- Add new students with ID, name, and marks
- View all student records
- Update a student’s name and marks using their ID
- Delete a student by ID
- Works through a clean text-based menu in the terminal
##  Tech used
- Java
- IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code
- Java Collections (ArrayList)
- Scanner (for CLI input)
##  Files in this project

- `Student.java`: This is the model class with private fields, constructor, getters, and setters.
- `StudentManager.java`: This handles all the logic like adding, updating, viewing, and deleting student records.
- `Main.java`: This is the starting point of the program. It runs the CLI.
##  Why I built this

I wanted to understand how to apply object-oriented programming in a real-world-like task. Managing records is a common use case, so building this helped me see how classes, methods, and lists work together to perform useful actions.
##  How to run it
1. Make sure Java is installed 
2. Open the project folder in terminal or command prompt
3. Compile the files
